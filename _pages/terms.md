Emojym and the materials in Emojym and on our website are provided on an 'as is' basis. To the extent permitted by law, Goodwhale EURL makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property, or other violation of rights.

In no event shall Goodwhale EURL or its suppliers be liable for any consequential loss suffered or incurred by you or any third party arising from the use or inability to use Emojym, our website, or any other services provided by Goodwhale EURL or the materials in Emojym, even if Goodwhale EURL or an authorized representative has been notified, orally or in writing, of the possibility of such damage.

In the context of this agreement, “consequential loss” includes any consequential loss, indirect loss, real or anticipated loss of profit, loss of benefit, loss of revenue, loss of business, loss of goodwill, loss of opportunity, loss of savings, loss of reputation, loss of use and/or loss or corruption of data, whether under statute, contract, equity, tort (including negligence), indemnity, or otherwise.
